        title: "reimaging the digital interface",
        text: `&nbsp;A digital interface can be seen as a human-to-computer conversation. Interfaces receive input and respond with feedback. However, as with human-to-human conversations, these conversations involve power dynamics, rooted in the the information and degree of autonomy the human has access to within the interaction. For example, a coder will have a higher degree of power than someone else because they have a higher degree of insight into the systems they are using (and that are using them). Understanding the existing dynamics of power within human-computer interaction is necessary before we can begin to reimagine digital interfaces.

        <br><br>&nbsp;With this framing in mind, I would like to explore the following question - what would a digital interface look like if technology were treated as a finite resource, rather than an infinite well we can dig from? For example, imagine what a website might look like if we understood the underlying server as only being able to respond a finite number of requests over a period of time? In this case, the website would surely be less efficient, but it would also be significantly less energy consumptive. How would this reprioritization lead us to shift our expectations of technology? 
        
        <br><br>&nbsp;I’d like to propose a radical change in the goal of the interface, which currently is to create effortless digital experiences, toward creating mindful interactions. Currently, it is only when there is a system glitch (i.e our computer gets hot and loud, or a web link takes a very long time to load), that we feel the heaviness of our digital consumption. I propose that some of this “weight” should be involved in an interface design. Maybe, it is important that we don’t experience our digital interactions as effortless in order to develop critically intentional and mindful habits of consuming technology.
        
        <br><br>&nbsp;Historically, the digital interface has been developed to obscure the connections between technology and our physical reality. What could result from reversing this and intentionally designing interfaces to reveal the ways technology is a resource that is directly tied to the land? How would the internet look if it was understood as a form of fracking?
        
        <br><br>&nbsp;The hyper-consumption of technology is a multilayered issue -  i.e the carbon cost of hardware with short lifecycles and our growing dependency on this hardware. This stratification roots back to the different power dynamics I mentioned earlier - between those creating technology, and those experiencing an increased reliance on it. I’d like to propose collective creation of the technology as key to designing interfaces that facilitate equitable interactions between humans and humans and the planet, which I will to refer as “sustainable interfaces”.
        
        <br><br>&nbsp;When I began writing this, I initially imagined a multitude of ways in which the people building technology could design interfaces that prioritized creating mindful, informed habits of digital consumption. I still believe there are many actions to be taken here. For example, a sustainable interface could be designed as responsive to real-time local energy grid usage, providing different a different view based on local consumption. For example, when the grid usage is high, FaceTime calls could be blocked and an alternative way of connecting could be offered, such as proposed in Lu Ye’s Onlign OS (1). In this way, a sustainable interface would create a collective equivalent to the current “low power mode” offered to individuals. However, I am concerned that following this approach, the main accountability for the environmental impact of technology would be offloaded onto the users of technology. This is why I believe the only path to building truly sustainable interfaces, for creating technology informed by users and that informs users, is in the collective engagement in the design and development of these interfaces.
